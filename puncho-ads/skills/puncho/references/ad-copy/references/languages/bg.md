# Writing ad copy in Bulgarian

Read this before drafting any line in Bulgarian, and again for the
read-aloud pass. A Bulgarian reader hears a translated line at once, even when
they cannot say why, and a translated line reads as a foreign brand or as a
machine. Nearly every weak Bulgarian line found in this pipeline was English
ad copy with Bulgarian words in it: the rhythm, the grammar and the jokes of
an American feed.

The examples here are invented, from other categories, to show the shape.
Never reuse one. The brand's own posts, voice samples and a person's edits
are the better evidence: where they disagree with this file, they win.

## The read-aloud test

Say the line out loud as you would say it to a friend across a kitchen
table, or in a message to them. If you would not say it, or would say it
with other words, the ad says it with those words. Then ask: would a
Bulgarian copywriter write this, or is it an English line translated?

A line passes when a reader understands it the first time, with no second
reading to work out what it means. Clever and cryptic is a fail: the reader
scrolls on before decoding it.

## Shapes that are native

- **A whole sentence, spoken.** "Не го отваряй преди гостите да са дошли."
  "Кафето ти е изстинало, докато четеш имейли." Bulgarian ad copy is mostly
  full sentences with a verb in them, addressed to "ти".
- **A question the reader answers in their head**, or takes a side on:
  "С мляко или без?", "Колко филии ще изядеш, преди да е станало време за
  закуска?", "Кой у вас изяжда последното парче?" Brands here run their
  organic as questions and guessing games; a question that worked in their
  feed is evidence.
- **The clause that carries the moment**: "Щом отвориш буркана, …",
  "Като се върнеш от работа, …", "Ако си от хората, които …".
- **Everyday situations everyone knows**: гости, неделя, баба, работа,
  понеделник, опашката, пътят до морето, детето, което не яде. Bulgarian
  humour is understatement and self-irony about these, not a punchline.
- **Warm small words where they are real**: бурканче, филийка, чашка,
  парченце. Food copy uses them; a bank does not.
- **Particles of speech**, sparingly and only where the brand's own writing
  has them: "пък", "чак", "направо", "ей така", "си" ("вземи си").

## Shapes that read as translated

| Translated | Why it fails | Native |
|---|---|---|
| "Кафе. Мляко. Понеделник." | Three fragments in a row: the "X. Y. Z." of American ads | "Понеделник е, но кафето е с мляко." |
| "Отвориш. И ухае." | A verb alone as a sentence. A perfective present ("отвориш", "гризнеш") cannot stand by itself | "Щом отвориш пакета, ухае на хляб." |
| "Захарта е една." | English "is one". The reader does not know what it means | "Само една захар: тръстикова." / "Без друга захар." |
| "Опечен е хлябът. Хрупкавостта остава." | The verb pushed first for emphasis, and an abstract noun as subject | "Хлябът е опечен сутринта и още хрупка." |
| "Чашата е преди телефона." | English "comes before": a slogan in no one's mouth | "Първо кафето, после телефонът." |
| "Направено с любов." / "Създадено за теб." | A passive participle as a headline: corporate and empty | Say who made it and how: "Печем го в пет сутринта." |
| "Ти заслужаваш най-доброто." / "Направи разликата." / "Следващо ниво." | English idioms word for word | Say the concrete thing. |
| "Вземи твоето кафе." | English possessive. Bulgarian drops it or uses "си" | "Вземи си кафето." |
| "Ние вярваме, че…" | A company speaking about itself | Say what the reader gets. |
| "Вкусово изживяване", "перфектният избор", "незабравимо" | Words of a press release | The taste itself: "солено, после сладко". |

## The spoken word, not the label's

The label, the website and the regulation use the formal word; the ad uses
the one a person says. "консумира се" is "яде се"; "продукт" is the thing's
name; "натурален" is usually "истински" or a fact; "лиофилизирани" may be
true and still belongs in the caption or the pack's facts, not the hook. Keep
the formal word only where it is the fact being sold.

## Small rules that show

- Sentence case: only the first word and names take a capital. Never Title
  Case a headline.
- Quotes are „…“.
- A dash between clauses is " – " with spaces, and it is rare. An em dash
  joining two abstractions is banned in every language here.
- A comma before "че", "който", "която", "като", "защото", "ако", "щом" when
  they open a clause.
- Units as people write them: "250 г", "2 с.л.", "1 ч.л.". A price exactly as
  the store writes it.

## Before storing

For every hook, headline, on-image line and primary text:

1. Read it out loud. Would you say it to a friend? If not, rewrite it as you
   would.
2. Does it make sense the first time, without the picture? A headline that
   needs decoding fails.
3. Is it a shape from the table above? Rewrite it in the native column's way.
4. Does it sound like the brand's own posts and a person's edits in
   `voice.edits`? Those decide.

store_specs refuses three of these shapes mechanically (fragments in a row, a
verb alone, "is one"). The rest is the reading above: the check cannot hear.
